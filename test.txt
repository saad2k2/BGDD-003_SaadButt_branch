My Ambition:

I don’t care much about politics, but I know it affects everything around us. Leaders make decisions that shape the economy, laws, and even the games we play. Some people argue all day about politicians, but at the end of the day, most of them just look out for themselves. I’d rather focus on my work and things I can control instead of getting stuck in debates that lead nowhere.I just want a system that lets people live their lives without unnecessary interference.
